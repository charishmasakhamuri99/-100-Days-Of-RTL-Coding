âœ… What is a Parallel Adder?
A parallel adder is a digital circuit that adds two binary numbers simultaneously, using multiple full adders (one per bit position). In a 2-bit parallel adder, each input is 2 bits wide, and the addition is performed bitwise in parallel.

ðŸ§  Concept of 2-bit Binary Addition
If:

Input A = a1a0 (2-bit)

Input B = b1b0 (2-bit)

Then the addition is:
   a1 a0
+  b1 b0
---------
  c2 c1 c0
c0 is the sum of LSB bits (a0 + b0)

c1 is the sum of MSB bits + carry from lower bit

c2 is the final carry-out (if any)

So the output is 3 bits (c2 c1 c0) to hold the full sum

âœ… Why Output is 3 Bits?
The maximum value from adding two 2-bit numbers is:

11 (binary) = 3 (decimal)
+
11 (binary) = 3 (decimal)
--------------------------
      110 (binary) = 6 (decimal)
So the result needs 3 bits to represent values from 0 to 6.

âœ… Testbench â€“ Purpose
The testbench is a simulation environment where:

Inputs (a and b) are provided manually

The output (c) is monitored to verify correctness

ðŸ§ª Simulation Steps
Inputs are applied in sequence: different combinations of 2-bit values for a and b.

Wait time (#10): allows signal propagation in simulation.

Waveform and Console Output: used to check if the adder behaves correctly.

Waveform File (VCD): captures signal transitions to visualize timing and output changes.

ðŸ“ˆ Waveform Explanation
In waveform:

Time progresses along the X-axis

Signals (a, b, and c) are plotted

You see a and b changing every 10ns

Corresponding changes in c happen immediately (since adder is combinational)

âœ… Use Cases of Parallel Adder
Arithmetic units in ALUs (Arithmetic Logic Units)

Digital signal processing (DSP)

Counters, timers, and control systems

âœ… Summary
Component	Purpose
2-bit adder	Adds two 2-bit binary numbers
3-bit output	Captures sum including carry
Testbench	Simulates the design with inputs and checks output
Waveform (VCD)	Visualizes how inputs and output behave over time
