An 8:3 encoder (also called an octal-to-binary encoder) is a combinational digital circuit that converts one of eight input signals into a 3-bit binary code at its output. This type of encoder is commonly used to reduce the number of data lines needed to represent multiple input signals in digital systems.

Working Principle
Inputs: The encoder has 8 input lines (commonly labeled as Y7 to Y0 or D7 to D0), each representing an octal digit.

Outputs: It produces 3 output lines (labeled as A2, A1, A0 or Q2, Q1, Q0), which represent the binary code corresponding to the active input line.

Operation:

At any given time, only one input line should be high (logic 1), and the output will be the binary representation of the index of that input.

For example, if input Y3 is high, the output will be 011 (binary for 3).

Truth Table
Inputs (Y7-Y0)	Outputs (A2 A1 A0)
00000001	000
00000010	001
00000100	010
00001000	011
00010000	100
00100000	101
01000000	110
10000000	111
Boolean Expressions
The outputs can be derived using OR logic as follows:

A0 = Y1 + Y3 + Y5 + Y7

A1 = Y2 + Y3 + Y6 + Y7

A2 = Y4 + Y5 + Y6 + Y7

This means each output bit is high if any of the corresponding input lines are high.

Block Diagram
The block diagram consists of:

8 input lines connected to a logic circuit (usually OR gates)

3 output lines that provide the binary code for the active input

Applications
Data Compression: Reduces the number of wires needed to transmit multiple signals.

Digital Systems: Used in keyboards, memory address decoders, and data multiplexing.

Key Points
Only one input should be active at a time for correct operation.

If multiple inputs are active, the basic encoder may produce incorrect outputs; a priority encoder is used to resolve this.

“At the output of the Encoder, we get the desired logic pulse at the output in a binary form corresponding to its octal equivalent. For example, if logic high pulse is applied at the input of encoder (pin 6), we will get its binary Equivalent as (Q2, Q1, Q0) = (1 1 0)”.

In summary:
An 8:3 encoder efficiently translates one of eight input signals into a 3-bit binary code, simplifying the representation and transmission of multiple digital signals in electronic systems.
