1. Definition & Operation
An AND gate is a basic digital logic component that outputs a 1 (HIGH) only when all inputs are 1. If any input is 0, the output is 0. In Boolean algebra, this is expressed as:

ini
Copy
Edit
Y = A · B   (or simply Y = AB)
— where · represents logical multiplication 

2. Truth Table (for 2 inputs)
A	B	Y
0	0	0
0	1	0
1	0	0
1	1	1

This matches the operation of binary multiplication: only 1 × 1 = 1; all others are 0 .

3. Logical Conjunction
Also called a "logical AND" or "conjunction."

4. Generalization to Multiple Inputs
An AND gate can have any number of inputs (n‑inputs). Its output is 1 only when all n inputs are 1. In Boolean form:

ini
Copy
Edit
Y = A·B·C·...·N
There are 2ⁿ input combinations, but only one gives output 1 

5. Electronic Implementations
Built using transistors in series: only when all transistors conduct (all inputs HIGH), the output goes HIGH

7. Boolean Algebra Properties
Commutative: A·B = B·A

Associative: (A·B)·C = A·(B·C)

Distributive: A·(B + C) = A·B + A·C 

8. Application & Importance
Used where all conditions must be met (e.g., in control logic, safety circuits).

Fundamental for arithmetic logic units, address decoding, register control, etc. 

✅ Summary
The AND gate implements logical multiplication in digital circuits.

Output is HIGH only if every input is HIGH.

It’s a cornerstone of combinational logic, with clear Boolean properties and transistor-level implementation.
